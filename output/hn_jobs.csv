Streak,www.streak.com,Remote Only,Staff UI Engineer,,,,https://www.streak.com/careers/staff-ui-engineer,"Streak is a CRM built on Gmail. We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast. We want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits. We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership. Lastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here."

Talk to the users, then build it. Got a better tool in mind? Let's use it. We're running this hybrid on-prem/Azure/AWS setup and trying to get our IaC game going. 

What we need:
Someone who's worked with weird tech stacks before and can figure out obscure systems. Experience with retail/accounting is awesome but not required. Must know your way around version control and have strong opinions about your preferred editor for reasons. 

Comfortable talking to users and solving their actual problems. Bonus points if you've done multiunit retail before. 

Some real problems we're tackling:
- Our credit application system is this web app Frankenstein'd together by various devs - it works but the database updates are a mess. Help me fix our autopayments.
- Distribution uses this configurable-but-unfriendly desktop app. Need someone to really get how it's used and make it better - maybe through RPA, maybe just better docs and UI labels. 
- Work wherever you want. Occasional visits to Culver City helpful but not required.
- Flexible hours (we're PST, but just need some overlap for now - help me fix our async game?) International = hired through Upwork."

It's built like a sensor network: from the beginning to the end, every interaction with our website is tracked and used to update the model's understanding of student knowledge. Every interaction on our platform is a data point – highlights, answer changes, even the coins they earn. This gives us unprecedented insight into how top performers master complex material. We're capturing the real-time cognitive processes of the highest achievers, not just their scores. We are leveraging insights from behavioral economics to optimize learning through a proprietary coin system – what students prioritize, and how they respond to incentives. For example, we learned that higher-performing students on MCAT CARs reading passages actually highlight less rather than more, turning theory of excellent test-taking into data-driven insights."

Sourcegraph,https://sourcegraph.com,San Francisco,Technical Advisor,,,,https://grnh.se/0572f98b4us,"Sourcegraph is how enterprises industrialize software development with AI. We accelerate and automate how software is built in the world's most important companies, including 7/10 top software companies by market cap and 4/6 top US banks.

Every successful codebase becomes large and complex. Instead of improving the product, devs spend more of their time just understanding the code and doing low-level tasks. The solution is to accelerate humans doing what they're best at--and to automate the rest with AI agents, meaning more creativity and less toil for devs.

Kodex is an early stage startup so each engineer wears multiple hats. You will work as part of a small, talented team that includes engineers with experience at successful companies like Medium, HashiCorp, Microsoft, Mozilla, Meta, and Uber. In this role, you will:

- Work closely with our Director of Product to design, develop, and enhance features for our portal.
- Lead projects to optimize system performance, including database usage, encryption middleware, and front-end responsiveness.
- Participate in our on-call rotation (about one week every two months), where you'll address support requests, monitor metrics, and respond to incidents to ensure reliability.
- Review code and contribute to improving engineering best practices.

This role is ideal for full-stack generalists with T-shaped skills who thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy taking ownership. We're fully remote, the team is distributed across the continent. We meet up twice a year in various locations around the United States (past meetups were in Miami, Nashville, Seattle, and San Francisco). We don't sponsor visas.

Our founders have seen firsthand how difficult it is for public and private sectors to collaborate effectively–preventing real-world harm while respecting user privacy. Slow processes, clunky tools, and misuse by bad actors were common problems. Kodex was built to fix that. Our platform streamlines case management for Law Enforcement Response and Trust & Safety teams. It combines secure workflows, communication, and file transfers with features like document encryption, audit trails, agency verification, account takeover detection, and API integrations—delivering a complete legal response solution.

We’ve built a unique, gamified intelligent tutoring system, essentially a video game for learning the MCAT. Our platform is an intelligent tutoring system which diagnoses student weaknesses, assigns them content and videos in fun games, and then uses AI to tutor them on topics they struggle with. However, what we REALLY need is a software engineer who's good with data. It's built like a sensor network: from the beginning to the end, every interaction with our website is tracked and used to update the model's understanding of student knowledge. Every interaction on our platform is a data point – highlights, answer changes, even the coins they earn. This gives us unprecedented insight into how top performers master complex material. We're capturing the real-time cognitive processes of the highest achievers, not just their scores. We are leveraging insights from behavioral economics to optimize learning through a proprietary coin system – what students prioritize, and how they respond to incentives. For example, we learned that higher-performing students on MCAT CARs reading passages actually highlight less rather than more, turning theory of excellent test-taking into data-driven insights."

We're Railway, and we think infrastructure can be better. So far we've built out a platform loved by hundreds of thousands of users who simply tell us ""Give me Postgres"", ""Deploy this repo"", and we make it happen.

Fair warning! The problems are complex: home-rolled hypervisors, cut-above container orchestration, over/under/whateverlay networks, virtio device drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn't suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build it and we're looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun."

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.

We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.

We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.

Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.

We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.

We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents."
